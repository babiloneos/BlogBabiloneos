## Why "babiloneos"?

My nickname's story cames from my teenager age when i get interest on creating a pseudonym that reflects my personality and my person.

Babiloneos refuge little fragments of my name, my likes, my interests, skills, but over all reflects my philosofy of not ignoring my moral and etics at being behing a screen, because babiloneos is myself and my ideals.
